# Information Security IA
## Text-File-Encryption

We will use the cryptography library in python to encrypt a file. The cryptography library uses a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the file. In the symmetric algorithm, we use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the file. The fernet module of the cryptography package has inbuilt functions for the generation of the key, encryption of plain text into cipher text, and decryption of cipher text into plain text using the encrypt() and decrypt() methods respectively. The fernet module guarantees that data encrypted using it cannot be further manipulated or read without the key.
